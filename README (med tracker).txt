1. login_gui.py           -> Main GUI logic (login, signup, dashboard, forms)
2. backend.py             -> Database and logic for users, medicines, reminders
3. reminder_notifier.py   -> Background task that checks and sends medicine reminders
4. med_tracker.db         -> SQLite database (auto-created if not found)
5. README.txt             -> This file

----------------------------------------
ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
----------------------------------------

1. Place all the project files in a single folder.

2. Open a terminal in that folder and run:
     python login_gui.py

   This will open the main GUI.

3. Open a second terminal in the same folder and run:
     python reminder_notifier.py

   This will enable reminder notifications in the background.

----------------------------------------
ðŸ›  Common Issues & Fixes
----------------------------------------

- "No module named plyer":
  Make sure you installed it using: pip install plyer

- GUI doesn't open:
  Ensure Tkinter is available (comes by default with most Python installations).

- Notifications don't show up:
  Make sure system notifications are enabled in Windows settings.

----------------------------------------
ðŸ§  Developer Notes & Problems Faced
----------------------------------------

- Designed complete user auth and medicine management logic.
- Integrated SQLite3 to persist medicine and reminder data.
- Faced challenges with sending reminders when GUI is closed â€“ solved it using a separate Python process.
- Tried converting to .exe but reverted to Python version to keep it simple and editable.
